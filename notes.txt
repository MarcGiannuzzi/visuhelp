When a parent is updated, it's child constructor is not called, only it's child render method.
To pass information from a parent to a child, we need to pass it through the child props (related to the state of the parent).


When there is a change in an element in React, ONLY THE RENDER METHOD IS CALLED, NOT THE CONSTRUCTOR !

ORDER : The setState callback finishes before the end of the render function, but when setState is called, render is automatically called.

My main mistake was to put multiple variables in setState which is not needed : it is better to have only one in order to reduce the number of times
the render method is called through setState !!!
